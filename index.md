## About Me as A Person

I am James Nguyen a sophmore computer **engineering** major and I'm looking forward to this quarter of collaboration.

Some hobbies that I have are:
- Playing video games
- Working out
- Manga/Anime things
- Eating good food
- Watching TV Shows

Some things I hope to achieve in the near future include:
- [ ] Learn how to be a better coder
- [ ] Get an internship
- [ ] Go on a road trip with friends
- [ ] Go hiking somewhere with a good view

If I had to pick a quote that best relates to me it would be a quote from author H. Jackson Brown, Jr.:
> The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.

This quote relates well to me because I tend to operate better when working in the moment and feeling things out as I go along. This also means that I tend to learn better through experience for better or for worse. I've learned that, just as this quote states, when you focus on performing your best in the current moment, you will better set yourself up for the future.

## About Me as A Programmer
As a programmer the languages that I am comfortable using currently include: python, Java, C, and C++. However, I am always willing to explore and learn new languages or IDE's if there is ever a need to do so.

### How I Code
Typically when writing code, I usually format my code as follows:
```
\\Comments with useful information
nameOfCode(){
    \\Comments
    \\Block of Code
}
```
This is really just to give an idea of what to expect if you were to ever look into my code so that you would hopefully know what you are looking at.

My future goals and aspirations as a programmer will be to enter into the field of robotics or aerospace and design something that pushes the boundaries of technology. This was mainly sparked by my participation in a robotics team or other extracurricular activities. If you would like to know more about the projects I have worked on in the past, feel free to take a look at [this](PastProjects.txt) file.

Thats it!
