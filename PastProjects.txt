Highschool Robotics:
Firstly, there was the highschool robotics team I was apart of where I would be in charge of managing the electronic components onto test and competition robots that were designed
to complete specific missions each year. I would work with people on the software team to test and modify the robot to be the best in the competition. It was really the experience
that opened me up to working on group projects and being comfortable sharing ideas in a group setting. If I had not done this in highschool I probably would not have ended up where
I am today.

Solar Powered Boat:
I worked with a bunch of friends and a teacher to create a motor boat that was partially powered through solar panels for a competition held in southern california. Overall just a
really fun experience to build something from scratch with a bunch of friends and have that thing actually be functional.

SEDS:
Currently a part of this club on campus that designs tests and builds rockets with the objective of giving students experience in the practices of the aerospace industry. Really
got me to do tasks that I could have never done in highschool and really broadened by perspective on the field of work that I was looking to go into. Hopefully before I graduate we
will be able to launch a rocket and see it fly without it exploding in our faces.
